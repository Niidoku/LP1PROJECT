# Title
### AN ANALYSIS OF THE INDIAN STARTUP ECOSYSTEM: A DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

## Project Description
The Indian start-up ecosystem has undergone remarkable growth, drawing significant attention in recent years. Funding stands as a crucial catalyst propelling the trajectory of these start-ups, facilitating scalability, fostering innovation, and generating substantial impacts. Hence, the objective of the "Indian Start-up Funding Analysis" project is to comprehensively explore the funding landscape for start-ups in India within the period from 2018 to 2021. This exploration aims to uncover underlying trends, patterns, and influential factors driving start-up funding in the country.

The project is anchored by a robust hypothesis and a series of probing questions designed to guide the analysis, unveiling crucial insights. These questions span diverse facets, encompassing the trends in funding received, the sectoral distribution, the interplay between sector and location, total funding distributions across regions, top-ranking companies based on funding, average funding at different stages of the start-up lifecycle, the yearly champions in funding, and the relationship between headquarters location and funding patterns.

## Project Significance
The essence of this analysis lies in its potential to offer invaluable insights to entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers. Entrepreneurs can align strategies by understanding funding trends and identifying sectors ripe for growth and investment. Investors can make informed decisions on fund allocation for optimal returns. Policymakers can leverage these insights to assess the ecosystem's health and discern areas necessitating supportive policies and interventions.

## Project Approach
To ensure a systematic and comprehensive approach to unravelling the complexities of the data, the project has adopted the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. Renowned for its structured methodology in guiding data mining and analysis projects, CRISP-DM ensures a methodical sequence of steps are undertaken to derive meaningful and actionable insights from the data at hand.

### Data Description
1.	Company/Brand: Contains the names of start-up companies.
2.	Founded: Represents the founding year of each start-up.
3.	Sector: Indicates the industry or sector to which the start-up belongs (e.g., FinTech, E-commerce, EdTech, etc.).
4.	What it does: Provides a concise description of the products or services offered by the company.
5.	Founders: Includes the names of the founders associated with each start-up.
6.	Investor: Contains the names of investors who have contributed funding to the start-ups.
7.	Amount ($): Represents the total funds raised by each start-up.

### Data Collection and Cleaning
Data for this project was sourced from three different platforms (database, OneDrive, GitHub). The datasets underwent a meticulous cleaning process, addressing duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies. The CRISP-DM framework ensured a systematic approach, preparing the data for in-depth analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis covers a range of topics, utilizing Python code snippets and visualizations. Key insights include trends in funding, top sectors, geographical influences, and more. The analysis is presented in a clear and concise manner, making complex information accessible.

### Hypothesis Testing
A statistical t-test was employed to investigate the relationship between a company's location and the amount of funding it receives. The results reject the null hypothesis, indicating that funding is dependent on location for startups in India.
